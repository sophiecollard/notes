# Zero to One

#### On the world until now
There are two modes of economic growth: technology and globalization. Technology takes the world from 0 to 1 by creating radically new ideas and products. Globalization takes the world from 1 to n by spreading the same old ideas and products to new markets.

Between the first world war and the 70s was a time of rapid technological development but not much globalization. Since the reopening of the relations between the US and China starting in 1971, we have seen rapid globalization along with limited technological development, mostly confined to IT.

#### On people's views of the future
There are 4 ways to view the future: definite optimism (US in the 60s and 70s), indefinite optimism (US since the 80s), definite pessimism (China today) and indefinite pessimism (Europe today). The definite view is that you can shape the future. The indefinite view is that the world is ruled by randomness and you have no control over what's to come.

Three of those views can work. Definite optimism works when you build the future you envision. Definite pessimism works by copying what has already worked, without expecting anything new. Indefinite pessimism is self-fulfilling. Only indefinite optimism is inherently unsustainable. How can the future get better if no one plans for it?

Finance epitomizes indefinite thinking because it's the only way to make money when you have no idea how to create wealth.

#### On competition
Perfect competition in free markets destroys profits. No profits means no possibility to invest in further technological developments, and leads to stagnation. Hence, competition is not only bad for firms but also, in the long term, for consumers who see a slower pace of technological innovation. You should aim to create a monopoly.

Monopolies are built on one or more of the following advantages: proprietary technology, network effects, economies of scale, and branding.

The act of creation is far more important than the fact that old industries might not like what you create. If your company can be summed up by its opposition to already existing firms, it can't be completely new and is unlikely to become a monopoly.

Don't fall prey to the temptation of defining your company as serving an extremely narrow market to give yourself and others the illusion that you are building a monopoly. While most startups begin by serving a very narrow market before expanding into adjacent ones (see section on network effects), this market needs to be isolated and served by few or no competitors.

Eg: You may be the only British food restaurant in Palo Alto but you won't have a monopoly. This is because your real market is not that of restaurants serving roast beef and Yorkshire pudding. Rather, you're competing with thousands of others in the restaurant market for practically any type of cuisine priced between $20 and $50 per person. Plus there may be good reasons there are no other restaurants serving British food in Palo Alto.

#### On network effects
Network effects can only be harnessed with a product that is valuable to its very first users, when the network is necessarily small.

Businesses relying on network effects must therefore start with especially small markets, of which they can rapidly capture a big share. The ideal target is a small group of particular people concentrated together and served by few or no competitors.

Eg: Facebook with Harvard students or Paypal with eBay powersellers.

This is why such businesses are rarely started by MBA types: the initial markets are so small that they often don't even appear to be market opportunities at all.

#### On distribution
There are 4 distribution channels: viral growth (CAC ~ <$1), marketing (CAC ~ $10-$100), personal sales (CAC ~ $1,000-$10,000) and complex sales (CAC ~ $100,000-$10M).

If you can get just one distribution channel to work, you have a great business. If you try for several but don't nail one, you're finished.

A product is viral if its core functionality encourages users to invite their friends/business partners to become users too.

Eg: Paypal first acquired a small user base of eBay buyers by offering them $10 upon sign up, an unsustainable growth tactic. But once it had built this user base, other eBay users were encouraged to join Paypal as well by the prospect of buyers sending them money instantly and securely.

#### On planning and the lean startup methodology
Iteration without a bold plan won't take you from 0 to 1. Darwinism may be a fine theory in other contexts, but in startups, intelligent design works best.

When a big company makes an offer to acquire a successful startup, it almost always offers too much or too little. Founders only sell when they have no more concrete visions for the company, in which case the acquirer probably overpaid. A business with a good definite plan will always be underrated in a world where people see the future as random, so an acquirer would probably offer too little.

#### On starting your own company vs working for someone else
Startup valuations follow a power law: the most valuable company in a portfolio will be more valuable than all of the other companies in the portfolio put together.

A consequence of the power law is that, in terms of financial gain, impact, prestige, etc, differences between companies will dwarf differences in roles inside companies.

People who understand the power law will hesitate more than others when it comes to founding their own venture: they know how tremendously successful they could become by joining the very best company while it's growing fast.

#### Questions to generate new ideas
*What do you know that other people don't?*

Eg: While generic cleantech companies struggled to differentiate themselves, Tesla built a unique brand around the insight that cleantech was more of a social phenomenon than an environmental imperative.

*How much of what you know about business is shaped by misguided reactions to past mistakes?*

Eg: The lean startup methodology was a reaction to the dot com bubble burst. However, followed too rigorously it tends to lead only to small incremental improvements over existing products rather than radical innovation.

*Are there any fields that matter but haven't been standardized and institutionalized?*

Eg: Nutrition is rather important in our everyday life, but most of the research was done in the 50s and 60s and turned out to be seriously wrong.

#### Questions to test the viability of an idea
Can you create breakthrough technology instead of incremental improvements?

Is now the right time to start your particular business?

Are you starting with a big share of a small market?

Do you have the right team?

Do you have a way to not just create but deliver (sales, marketing, viral growth) your product?

Will your market position be defensible 10 and 20 years into the future?

Have you identified a unique opportunity that others don't see?
